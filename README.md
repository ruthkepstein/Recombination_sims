# Recombination_sims

All files in this repository were generated to simulate various recombination landscapes in maize & rice. If files do not have a species name, assume maize.

Several mutants, zmet2, ddm1, fancm, recq4, ddm1/zmet2 (ideal2), and a global 10X increase in recombination (ideal1), were used in this study. To access creation of the geneic maps
of each of these mutants, go to the name of mutant's file. The simulations, the recurrent selection or introgression schemes, were done in separate files from the creation of the genetic maps.

Graphs used in the manuscript are in "Plots" for maize and "Plots_rice" for rice.

Analysis of the correlation between the gene space & recombination rate was done in "gene space sims.R" for both maize & rice. Simulations on different selection intensities are locted in "selection intensities". This was only done in maize.
